Basic problem-solving techniques and algorithm development through the process of top-down stepwise refinement and functional decomposition are introduced throughout the course. Classical numerical problems encountered in science and engineering are used to demonstrate the development of algorithms and their implementations.  May not be taken for credit by Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer Engineering majors.  This course is designed for Electrical Engineering and Micro-Electronic Engineering majors and students interested in the Electrical Engineering minor.", "academicGroup": "KGCOE", "maximumUnits": 3, "minimumUnits": 3, "gradingBasis": "GRD", "associatedClassNumber": "601", "autoEnrollSect1": " ", "autoEnrollSect2": " ", "courseId": "112768", "printTopic": "N", "courseTopicId": "0", "associatedComponents": [], "attributes": {"PERS": ["Mathematical Perspectives"], "SMTL": ["Science/Math Literacy"], "GE": ["General Education Elective"]}, "attributeKeys": ["GE", "PERS", "SMTL"], "attributeDescriptions": ["General Education Elective", "Mathematical Perspectives", "Science/Math Literacy"], "attributeValues": ["GENED ELEC", "SCIMATH", "MATHEMATIC"], "preReqDescriptions": [], "preReqDescrsShort": [], "preReqDescrsLong": ["RIT Dubai Prerequisites:  (MATH-181 or MATH-181A or MATH-171) and (MCEE-BS or EEEE-BS or ENGRX-UND or EEEEDU-BS or ENGXDU-UND) or equivalent courses."], "associatedClasses": [], "instructorFullName": "Omar Abdul Latif", "instructorEmail": "omacad@rit.edu", "meetings": [{"days": "Tue Thu", "daysFull": "Tuesday Thursday", "location": "To Be Determined", "instructor": "Omar Abdul Latif", "locationShort": "TBD", "time": "09:00 AM - 10:20 AM", "instructorEmail": "omacad@rit.edu", "date": "08/28/2023 - 12/05/2023", "daytimes": "Tue Thu 09:00 AM - 10:20 AM"}], "statusImage": "./assets/svgLib/open_dot.svg", "reservedCap": [], "consent": "N"}]}
