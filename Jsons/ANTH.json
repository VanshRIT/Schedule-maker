This course will explore leading theories related to the origins of contemporary nationalism and nationalism's importance within the context of state societies, especially in Europe. The past as an invented historical or imagined reality will be highlighted, as invented pasts contribute to claims for exclusive national culture and both exclusive and contested identities. The relationships between culture, literacy, and capitalism will be applied to understanding select historical and ethnographic cases of nationalism.", "academicGroup": "CLA", "maximumUnits": 3, "minimumUnits": 3, "gradingBasis": "GRD", "associatedClassNumber": "600", "autoEnrollSect1": " ", "autoEnrollSect2": " ", "courseId": "114198", "printTopic": "N", "courseTopicId": "0", "associatedComponents": [], "attributes": {"GE": ["General Education Elective"]}, "attributeKeys": ["GE"], "attributeDescriptions": ["General Education Elective"], "attributeValues": ["GENED ELEC"], "preReqDescriptions": [], "preReqDescrsShort": [], "preReqDescrsLong": ["RIT Dubai "], "associatedClasses": [], "instructorFullName": "Yahya Haider", "instructorEmail": "yrhcad@rit.edu", "meetings": [{"days": "Mon Wed", "daysFull": "Monday Wednesday", "location": "To Be Determined", "instructor": "Yahya Haider", "locationShort": "TBD", "time": "01:05 PM - 02:25 PM", "instructorEmail": "yrhcad@rit.edu", "date": "08/28/2023 - 12/05/2023", "daytimes": "Mon Wed 01:05 PM - 02:25 PM"}], "statusImage": "./assets/svgLib/waitlist.svg", "reservedCap": [], "consent": "N"}, {"subject": "ANTH", "enrollmentStatus": "Waitlist", "classType": "E", "component": "LEC", "instructionMode": "P", "campus": "DUBAI", "term": "2231", "academicGroupShort": "CLA", "academicCareer": "UGRD", "courseTitleLong": "Culture and Politics in the Middle East", "catalogNumber": "365", "waitCap": 15, "classNumber": "16778", "sessionCode": "DU1", "waitTotal": 5, "enrollmentCap": 30, "ppSearchId": "113653-1-2231-DU1-600", "academicTitle": "College of Liberal Arts", "location": "DUBAI", "enrollmentTotal": 30, "classSection": "600", "courseDescription": "With a focus on everyday life in families, communities, and nations, we examine the diverse cultures and peoples of the Middle East in the context of political and economic forces that have shaped their lives in the past and present.

This course explores core tenets of Islam, but also how its practices and beliefs are altered as practitioners in different countries alternately adopt, co-opt, massage, react to, and reject elements in accordance with the meaningful social, cultural, and political lives they build for themselves. The compatibility of Islam with Western society is often debated in contemporary public discourse. This debate is typically marked by an assumption that Islamic beliefs clash with Western secular democratic ideals, an assumption which results in tensions over mosque building, headscarves, and other public signs of Islamic faith. We will explore the diverse ways of being Muslim from a cross-cultural perspective and the sometimes-challenging negotiation of fulfilling these religious tenets while living in Muslim-minority places.", "academicGroup": "CLA", "maximumUnits": 3, "minimumUnits": 3, "gradingBasis": "GRD", "associatedClassNumber": "600", "autoEnrollSect1": " ", "autoEnrollSect2": " ", "courseId": "200816", "printTopic": "N", "courseTopicId": "0", "associatedComponents": [], "attributes": {"PERS": ["Global Perspective"], "GE": ["General Education Elective"]}, "attributeKeys": ["GE", "PERS"], "attributeDescriptions": ["General Education Elective", "Global Perspective"], "attributeValues": ["GENED ELEC", "GLOBAL"], "preReqDescriptions": [], "preReqDescrsShort": [], "preReqDescrsLong": ["RIT Dubai "], "associatedClasses": [], "instructorFullName": "Yahya Haider", "instructorEmail": "yrhcad@rit.edu", "meetings": [{"days": "Tue Thu", "daysFull": "Tuesday Thursday", "location": "To Be Determined", "instructor": "Yahya Haider", "locationShort": "TBD", "time": "10:30 AM - 11:50 AM", "instructorEmail": "yrhcad@rit.edu", "date": "08/28/2023 - 12/05/2023", "daytimes": "Tue Thu 10:30 AM - 11:50 AM"}], "statusImage": "./assets/svgLib/waitlist.svg", "reservedCap": [], "consent": "N"}]}
