This course is designed to help students who want to: connect previously learned and newly encountered concepts; connect math techniques with recently encountered and previously learned physics concepts; connect textbook physics examples and problems in familiar and un-familiar contexts. This course is useful for students who have not taken physics for a while and want to strengthen their physics background before registering for RIT physics credit courses, and also for those more advanced in their physics course sequence who may not have had a satisfactory result in their physics course and want to review and retain as well as build new understanding.\n\nThe specific topics of the course will be based on the current physics background and impending physics needs of students enrolled in the course. A customized list of review topics, called a Study Plan will be created based on the results of an initial inventory and/or series of evaluations taken by the students. Students will review topics that are identified in their personalized Study Plan to strengthen their physics concepts and review mathematical techniques, as needed.", "academicGroup": "STUAF", "maximumUnits": 0, "minimumUnits": 0, "gradingBasis": "S/F", "associatedClassNumber": "600", "autoEnrollSect1": " ", "autoEnrollSect2": " ", "courseId": "201753", "printTopic": "N", "courseTopicId": "0", "associatedComponents": [], "attributes": {}, "attributeKeys": [], "attributeDescriptions": [], "attributeValues": [], "preReqDescriptions": [], "preReqDescrsShort": [], "preReqDescrsLong": ["RIT Dubai "], "associatedClasses": [], "instructorFullName": " ", "meetings": [{"days": "Mon Wed", "daysFull": "Monday Wednesday", "location": "To Be Determined", "instructor": "To Be Announced", "locationShort": "TBD", "time": "01:05 PM - 02:25 PM", "instructorEmail": null, "date": "08/28/2023 - 12/05/2023", "daytimes": "Mon Wed 01:05 PM - 02:25 PM"}], "statusImage": "./assets/svgLib/open_dot.svg", "reservedCap": [], "consent": "D"}]}
